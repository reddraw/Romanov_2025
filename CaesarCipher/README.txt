This program is divided by three main functions:

Encrypt - it is the protocol used by program to cipher the word by using simple ASCII code.

Decrypt - it is the reversed encryption protocol used to test the program during Runner mode.

Runner - testification module with 3 prepared questions with answers. It is used to test both Encryption and Decryption
protocols.

Start it by pressing F5 or Run button. Right after that the chat will appear
with command

Print in case you want: 1) TEST to test the program, 2) any other word to cipher it

In case user prints "TEST" the program will start the runner module which will use both
encryption and decryption blocks.

In case user prints any other word the program will encript it and write down that way:
"original word" - main word
"ciphered" - ciphered word
"deciphered" - deciphered word
